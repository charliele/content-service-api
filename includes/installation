# Installation

> To install, use this code:

# install 3rd party dependencies
$ npm install

# install additional build tools
# run this if you get "cannot find tsc command" error
$ npm install -g typescript 
```

Install the Planning Analytics Workspace UI API by running these code examples in terminal or commandline.


# Running the application

```shell
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start-dev

# build
$ npm run build

# production mode
$ npm run start-prod
```

This application will read config values from the environment variables. What I usually do is set my dev env variables in `config/set-dev-variables.sh` and then run the script via source `config/set-dev-variables.sh` before running the below to have it run under the specified config variables. Check the <a href='https://github.ibm.com/PlanningAnalytics/paw-ui-api/blob/master/server/modules/config/config.service.ts'>config service</a> to see all available settings.

## Testing the application

```shell
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

Use these commands to test the application.
